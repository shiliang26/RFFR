# Real Face Foundation Representation Learning for Generalized Deepfake Detection

This repository is the official implementation of [Real Face Foundation Representation Learning for Generalized Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08439). 

This long-overdue paper was finally [published at *Pattern recognition*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320324010501) in Dec 2024.

## Overview

In this study, we propose Real Face Foundation Representation Learning (RFFR), which aims to learn a general representation from large-scale real face datasets and detect potential artifacts outside the distribution of RFFR.

## Preparations

- To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Download datasets at [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics), [ForgeryNet](https://yinanhe.github.io/projects/forgerynet.html), [Celeb-DF](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics), etc.

- Run face detection. With cropped face images, generate json files in the following format:

```
[
    {
        "path": "path/to/image_0.png",
        "label": 0
    },

    {
        "path": "path/to/image_1.png",
        "label": 1
    },

    ...
]

```

- Link the json files in the config files to load the data. You can also just modify the dataset files to load the images in any other ways you want.


## Training

Make sure to specify paths to labels, pretrained models, as well as hyperparameters in ```rffr_classifier/configs/config.py``` and ```rffr_generative/configs/config.py```.

To train the generative model that produces residuals:

```train
cd rffr_generative
python train.py
```

To train the classifier:

```train
cd rffr_classifier
python train.py
```


## Evaluation

Specify models to test in the aforementioned config files.

View demos of the generative model's output by running:

```eval
cd rffr_generative
python evaluate.py
```

Test the deepfake detector by running:

```eval
cd rffr_classifier
python test.py
```
